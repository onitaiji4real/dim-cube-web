      {
        "question": "Static sites have no interaction?",
        "answer": "Modern sites aren't static. We use Next.js to make websites feel as fast and fluid as Apps. Speed is money; every millisecond of delay loses customers."

      {
        "question": "What is GEO?",
        "answer": "GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) optimizes for AI like ChatGPT. Future search won't give 10 links, but 1 standard answer. We ensure your brand is that answer."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can't I just use ChatGPT to write content?",
        "answer": "AI can write words but lacks strategy and structured data. We build the underlying architecture that Google and AI can read, not just pile up text."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will I get traffic immediately?",
        "answer": "SEO is planting a tree; Ads are buying flowers. Trees take time (3-6 months) but shade you forever; flowers fade in 3 days."
