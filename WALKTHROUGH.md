# Dimension Cube Website Development Walkthrough

**Date**: 2024-12-08
**Status**: Beta Release (Internal Testing)

## 1. Overview
This session focused on transforming the static prototype into a fully internationalized (i18n), interactive, and polished website. The primary goals were to implement `zh-TW` and `en` support, refine the UI/UX, and prepare the project for handover.

## 2. Key Accomplishments

### 🌍 Internationalization (i18n)
- **Library**: Implemented `next-intl`.
- **Coverage**: 100% of the UI text is now extracted into dictionary files:
    - Path: `messages/zh-TW.json` (Traditional Chinese)
    - Path: `messages/en.json` (English)
- **Features**:
    - Language Toggle in Dock Nav.
    - Automatic locale detection and routing (`/[locale]/...`).

### 🛠 Component Enhancements
- **Dock Navigation**:
    - Fixed styling and z-index issues.
    - Added links to new pages (`/blog`).
    - Integrated Dark Mode and Language toggles.
- **Pricing Section**:
    - added **Scroll-triggered Fade Up** animation.
    - Highlighted "Plan B" as the recommended option.
    - Fixed layout issues and added checkmarks for features.
- **Footer**:
    - Added `pb-32` padding to prevent obstruction by the floating Dock Nav.
    - Localized copyright and links.
- **FAQ Section**:
    - Resolved specific syntax errors causing build failures.
    - Implemented smooth Accordion/Tab switching logic.
- **Contact Form**:
    - Integrated `sonner` for Toast notifications (Success feedback).
    - Added Zod schema validation for form fields.

### 📄 New Pages
- **Blog Page (`/blog`)**:
    - Created a dedicated route for insights and articles.
    - Currently reuses the `BlogSection` component as a preview.

## 3. Technical Fixes
- **Build Repairs**: Fixed critical "export" and "syntax" errors in `pricing.tsx`, `footer.tsx`, and `faq.tsx` caused by previous editing glitches.
- **Hydration**: Ensured `useEffect` and `"use client"` directives are correctly placed to prevent mismatch errors.

## 4. Next Steps
- **Backend Integration**: Connect the Contact Form to a real email service (Resend/SendGrid).
- **Legal Pages**: Create `privacy` and `terms` pages (currently empty links).
- **Blog Content**: Expand the blog into a full CMS-backed system (e.g., Markdown or Headless CMS).
